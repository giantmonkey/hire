## Criteria:
* The result in the bottom line should always be up-to-date.
* There should always be exactly 1 empty line before the result line.
* The input fields should only allow the input of valid german money values (e.g. `10,50`) and prevent the input of illegal values, e.g.
  * `10abc`
  * `10.50`
  * `10,111`
* The app should be tested, ideally via end-to-end and unit tests.

## What we are looking for:
* Test driven development
* Process of working documented by concise commits
* Clean, readable code
* Good accessibility
  
## Recommended time
